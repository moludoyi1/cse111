Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
    i fully saw the power of functions when i begna working on my final project,
    at first all thorough the semester i'd find it confusing using function but
    then there'd be times where i'm like this is amazing and i understand this.
    However, i fully saw the power of functions when i began writing my final project
    from scratch. yes i ran into a few road blocks but then i'd reach out to see others
    view on my idea and how i should go about it. it was just amazing that functions
    make complex codes simplier and easier to work on.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    i'd say the value of test function is to ensure that the various functions
    called in your main code are doing what is expected of them to do. eventhough
    we might be very confident that those functions are doing what they are coded
    to do; however, another way to ensure that is to have test functions in place
    to ensure it. think of the test function another assurance for your main functions. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
    at first i'd read the error that pops up when running that program, then i'd try
    to locate where the problem is coming from and after locating it, i'll try to fix
    the located problem. if i'm unable to figure out what the issue, i'd reach out to
    someone with better experience than me and have them also take a look at it. a thing
    i can do to improve my process is to not stare at the problem for too long before
    reaching out to others who can help, i found myself in situations where i take too
    long to reach out to theres to help me out.
